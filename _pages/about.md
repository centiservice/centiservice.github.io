Centiservice is home to a few libraries worth considering if you use a multi-service architecture.

The two main libraries hosted at [Centiservice github](https://github.com/centiservice) are Mats<sup>3</sup> and
MatsSocket. There are dedicated sites for them, at [mats3.io](https://mats3.io/)
and [matssocket.io](https://matssocket.io). Mats<sup>3</sup> also have a companion project called 
[MatsBrokerMonitor](https://github.com/centiservice/matsbrokermonitor).

For more about the author's philosophy around a multi-service architecture, one might want to
read [System of Services](https://github.com/centiservice/mats3/blob/main/docs/developing/SystemOfServices.md).
