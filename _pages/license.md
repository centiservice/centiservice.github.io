Mats<sup>3</sup> and MatsSocket, as well as MatsBrokerMonitor, is currently licensed under the _noncompete_ Polyform
Perimeter License, with a few examples of what you are not allowed to do. All the source is available at Github.

Licenses: [Mats<sup>3</sup>](https://github.com/centiservice/mats3/blob/main/LICENSE.md),
[MatsSocket](https://github.com/centiservice/matssocket/blob/main/LICENSE.md),
[MatsBrokerMonitor](https://github.com/centiservice/matsbrokermonitor/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

[Polyform Perimeter](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/perimeter/1.0.0/) is a noncompete license, which basically
means that you can do whatever you want with the code, except using it to compete with the product. Thus, as long as you
aren't making a Mats-like product, or are AWS, GCP or Azure, or any similar company providing services to the public,
typically for a fee, you should be in the clear. If you want to provide Mats or Mats-like features using Mats, we'll
need to have a chat.
